  <p>The application works by taking in an input three numbers and determining what kind of triangle the values would equate to</p>

    <h3>Overview of a Triangle</h3>
    <p>A triangle stands to remain one of the most basic shapes in geometry.<br>It can be understood as a poligon that has three vertices and three edges</p>

    <p>This type of triangle has two sides that are equal and have two consecutively equal angles</p>
    <br><li><strong>Scalene Triangle</strong></li>
    <p>This triangle has no equal sides as well as no equal angles</p>
