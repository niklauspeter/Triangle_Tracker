  <h1>Triangle Tracker</h1>
  <p>The application works by taking in an input three numbers and determining what kind of triangle the values would equate to</p>
  <h3>Overview of a Triangle</h3>
  <p>A triangle stands to remain one of the most basic shapes in geometry.<br>It can be understood as a poligon that has three vertices and three edges</p>
  <p>It is important to note that a triangle can only be, if the sum of two of its corresponding sides is greater than the other remaining side.</p>
  <h3>Types of a Triangle</h3>
  <div class="sidebar">
  <ol>
    <li>Equilateral Triangle</li>
    <p>This triangle is defined as having three equal sides and three equal angles, which are always 60Â°</p>
    <li>Isosceles Triangle</li>
    <br><p>This type of triangle has two sides that are equal and consequtively, two equal angles</p>
    <li>Scalene Triangle</li>
    <br><p>This triangle has no equal sides as well as no equal angles</p>
  </ol>
